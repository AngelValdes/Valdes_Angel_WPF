Taking the garbage out
Everyday, taking the garbage out is a trivial activity for me believe or not, it has several variables that completly change the activity complexity and duration from not having to do it, been easy, to been a painful activity. I will now describe the process below:

Every day when I go to work in the morning I check if there is a garbage bag waiting for me by the door. If there is, things are usually simple, I visually messure the bag, and if I think it feets thru the garbage disposal conduit, I just take it out and throu the bag thru the conduit that will eventually make it to the large trash Container in the first floor and I am done. But if the bug is too full and large, I then have to walk to the first floor myself and dispose it manually, which implies disconfort, carrying a heavy bag for a considerable distance, and a lost of time.

Sometimes there is no bag by the door, so I then "Must" (by my wife instructions) check if it is in the kitchen garbage container so then I take it out and procede to the usual process to dispose the garbage bag.
